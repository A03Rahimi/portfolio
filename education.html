		   <p>
              As I was encouraged to become a computer scientist since I
			  was a child, I started coding from a young age. I was keen to spend my time programming my
			  Arduino board and build DIY Projects to automate my room. I was successful to use and test 
			  a variety of modules and sensors that are compatible with Arduino.
			  In specific, some of the modules can be named as, Bluetooth module, WI-FI Module, GSM Module,
			  Relays, and Dot Matrix. And some sensors can be mentioned as, waterflow sensor, gas sensor,
			  temperature sensor, light sensor, ultra-sonic sensor, and more. I had applied some of them in my room and they worked. For instance 
			  I could turn the lights of my room on or off with my phone using a Bluetooth module and a relay connected to the Arduino.
           </p>

            Because I was a tall boy since I was a child, I was encouraged to start playing basketball.
			  I played basketball for years and I experienced 
			  lots of matches in diverse leagues varied from my school 
			  league to national leagues. I also nominated as an 
			  under 16 national-player in my country and I had the 
			  chance to be one of the top 15 players in the U16
			  national team.
